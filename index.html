        Welcome to my website, My name is Lee, and I am a passionate self-taught Developer.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        My interest in coding started while I was running my business in 2007. I was an onsite manager of my clothing
        outlet. I faced unaffordable Electronic Point of Sale (EPOS) software that was poorly made and did not suit my
        needs. I set about to make a version that suited my company's needs. If I had known how difficult a task lay
        ahead, I might never have started. But with an internet connection and some determination, I had a working
        solution.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        So began my life long love of software development.

        and instead embrace the concept of trying something new.</p>

            <p>A fun project. An Arduino connected to a custom-built PCB to control an RGB led strip. The Arduino uses a

              running on a PC reads screen data and decides what the dominant colour should be and messages the Arduino.
              This functions as movie mood lighting running at around 10-20fps.</p>

              This project was a combination of hardware-software. A Raspberry PI connected to a Came security gate PCB,
              and an IR sensor would know when objects passed through the gates. The raspberry pi would then query a NAS
              server that would be running a server program also written in python with the time of the event.
              The software on the NAS would constantly be buffering video into memory from a Foscam security camera and
              on
              receiving the request from the raspberry Pi would compile a jpeg video from historical memory and email it
              to me. A web server on the Raspberry PI would allow me to open, close, lock or unlock the security gates.
              I
              would also receive email notifications if the gates were left open after a specific time of day.
